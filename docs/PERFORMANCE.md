# Basic Performance Guidelines

## MVP Performance Goals
- Quick initial load time (under 3s)
- Smooth user interactions
- Mobile responsiveness

## Simple Optimizations

### 1. Image Optimization
- Use Next.js Image component
- Compress images before uploading
- Use appropriate image sizes

### 2. Code Organization
- Keep components simple
- Split larger components when needed
- Use proper imports

### 3. Data Handling
- Fetch only necessary data
- Use basic caching where possible
- Implement simple loading states

### 4. Firebase Tips
- Keep security rules simple but effective
- Create basic indexes for common queries
- Don't over-fetch documents

### 5. State Management
- Use React state efficiently
- Don't over-complicate with unnecessary state
- Keep contexts focused on specific features

## Testing Performance
- Use Chrome DevTools for basic profiling
- Check mobile responsiveness with device emulation
- Watch for obvious bottlenecks

## Future Considerations
For post-MVP iterations, consider:
- More advanced code splitting
- Server-side rendering optimizations
- Service worker implementation
